              <p class="card-text">I read this book before I started my coding bootcamp at Coding Dojo. I'd been studying algorithms on AppAcademy's online Bootcamp Prep program. I could code the algorithm to FizzBuzz, but I had no idea how complex algorithms could get. 
                
              <p>The computer science component of software engineering was completely foreign to me. I'd known basic HTML and CSS, but concepts of data structures such as arrays, binary search trees, singly-linked lists, stacks, and queues were completey outside of my realm of knowledge.</p> 
              
              <p>Re-reading this book after going through a coding bootcamp has given me a completely different perspective. In chapter one, the author, David Auerbach, talks about assembly language: 
                <p><kbd>"When I took a compiler class in college, the infrastructure of the computer opened up to me. There was no longer a miracle in between my code and its execution. I could see the whole picture, finally, and it was beautiful."</kbd></p>
              </p>

              <p>After finshing the coding bootcamp, I feel like I've uncovered a small portion of the whole picture. I know I have much to learn, but attending a coding bootcamp has given me the ability to see the inner-workings of the web and how all of it's component parts fit together.</p>

In addition to some phenomenal coffee from Peet's, she also got me whole beans from Stumptown so I could make use of this Cuisinart burr which belonged to my late grandfather. The great thing is it matches perfectly with the new coffee maker. I'm going to need all the coffee for late-night coding sessions. Particularly when we get to Java.</p>

The 300 pound elephant in the room--nay--the abomination that is the Houston Astro's cheating scandal has stained the game for many people, myself included. One person I talked to said he was no longer interested in baseball. It is particularly awful for players whose careers were shaped by the Astro's sign-stealing scheme. But one thing about this game is that cheating has and always will be part of the game.</p>
